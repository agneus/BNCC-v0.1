# BNCC-v0.1
BNCC Streamer
A project made using React where I used YouTube API to search results from YouTube, and react-youtube to render and play those videos. I implemented login, registration and logout functionality using firebase authentication, used React-Router to implement routing and effectively used CSS to provide a great dark themed UI.
